            <b>DATA:</b>
            <p>Data are the  Raw facts and figures that have not yet been processed to reveal their meaning. Data can be numerical, textual, or even multimedia. In its raw form, it is not very useful until it is processed and converted into information. Examples include a list of temperatures or sales figures.
            </p>
            <b>Information</b>
            <p>Information refers to data that has been organized, interpreted, and contextualized by a human or machine so that it possess relevance and purpose.</p>
            <b>Metadata</b>
            <p>Data that describes other data. In a DBMS, metadata provides information about the structure, operations, and constraints of the data within the database, such as table definitions, field types, and relationships.</p>
            <b>Data Dictionary</b>
            <p>
                A centralized repository of metadata. It contains definitions and descriptions of the data elements, structures, and rules in the database. The data dictionary helps in understanding the structure, relationships, and constraints of the data.
            </p>
            <b>Database</b>
            <p>
                An organized collection of structured data stored electronically. In a DBMS, a database is managed by the DBMS software and provides a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data
            </p>
            <b>Table</b>
            <p>
                A collection of related data entries in a database, organized in rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and each row (or record) in the table corresponds to a unique instance of that entity.
            </p>
            <b>Tuple(s)</b>
            <p>A single row or record in a table. A tuple represents a single data item, which is a collection of related data values for the various fields defined by the table's schema.</p>
            <b>
                Fields
            </b>
            <p>Columns in a table, also known as attributes. Each field represents a specific piece of data stored in a table, such as name, age, or address. Fields define the data type and nature of the data.
            </p>
            <B>Domain</B>
            <p>
                The set of permissible values that a field (or attribute) can take. For example, a domain for a "gender" field might be limited to the values 'Male', 'Female', and 'Other'.
            </p>
            <b>Constraints(s)</b>
            <P>Rules applied to data in a database to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Constraints can include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, not null constraints, and check constraints.</P>
            <b>Keys(s)</b>
            <p>
                Special fields used to identify records uniquely and establish relationships between tables. Keys include:
<ul class="key">
<li>Primary Key: A field (or combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.</li>
<li>Foreign Key: A field (or combination of fields) that establishes a link between the data in two tables, ensuring referential integrity.</li>
<li>Candidate Key: A field (or combination of fields) that can uniquely identify records and could be a primary key.</li>
<li>Composite Key: A primary key composed of two or more fields.</li>
</ul></p>
