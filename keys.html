            <b>Primary Key</b>
            <P>A primary key is a field (or a combination of fields) that uniquely identifies each row in a table.t cannot contain duplicate values or NULL values. It serves as the main identifier for records and is crucial for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.
            </P>
            <b>Foreign Key</b>
            <p>A foreign key is a field (or a combination of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
                A foreign key is a field (or a combination of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
            </p>
            <b>Candidate Key</b>
            <p> A candidate key is a field (or a combination of fields) that can uniquely identify a row in a table. A table can have multiple candidate keys, one of which is chosen as the primary key.</p>
            <b>Super Key</b>
            <p>A super key is a set of one or more columns that can be used to uniquely identify a row in a table. A candidate key is a minimal super key.</p>
            <b>Composite Key</b>
            <p>A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record in a table. Individually, each column in the composite key may not be unique, but their combination ensures uniqueness. It is useful when no single column can uniquely identify a record.
            </p>
            <b>Artificial Key</b>
            <p>An artificial key, also known as a surrogate key, is a type of primary key that is created solely for the purpose of uniquely identifying rows in a table. Unlike natural keys, which are based on existing data and have a real-world meaning, artificial keys are typically generated by the database system and have no inherent meaning outside the database.</p>
            <b>Alternate Key</b>
            <p>An alternate key is any candidate key in a table that is not chosen as the primary key. In other words, it's a field (or a combination of fields) that could uniquely identify a row in a table, but isn't the primary key.</p>
